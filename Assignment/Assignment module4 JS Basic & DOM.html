            <h2>1. What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web
                pages
                — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at
                —
                displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
                etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of
                standard
                web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS)</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
                multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing
                what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>
            <p>In simple words :- <br>

                JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows
                you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web
                pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.</p>

        <div class="que">
            <h2>2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h2>
            <p>isNaN() is a function property of the global object. For number values, isNaN() tests if the number is
                the value NaN . When the argument to the isNaN() function is not of type Number, the value is first
                coerced to a number, and the resulting value is then compared against NaN </p>
            <p>The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN when converted to a number. Because coercion
                inside the isNaN() function can be surprising, you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN().</p>
            <p>In Javascript isNaN() function is used to check if any value is NaN (which stands for 'Not-a-Number') or
                not. If the value passed is NaN, the function returns true else, it returns false.</p>
            <p>isNaN() is a function property of the global object.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>3. What is negative Infinity?</h2>
            <p>NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or
                mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in
                JavaScript (i.e., more negative than -Number. MAX_VALUE) . JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY
                value as -Infinity .</p>
            <p>In JavaScript there is a concept called negative infinity, which is less than any real number. <br>

                The symbol “-∞” is used to denote negative infinity.
                It is an infinitely long zip line in opposite directions. <br>

                Number. NEGATIVE_INFINITY returns negative infinity.
                Number. NEGATIVE_INFINITY is "a number lower than any other number".</p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>4. Which company developed JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262
                standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to
                develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5.</p>
            <p>Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web
                browser, Netscape Navigator.
                Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h2>
            <p>Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but does not have a value. Undeclared variable
                means that the variable does not exist in the program at all.</p>
            <p> <b> Undefined :- </b> <br> It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any
                value. Undefined is
                not a keyword. </p>
            <p> <b> Undeclared :-</b> <br> It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or
                declared earlier
                using the var or const keyword. If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclared variable,
                we will face the runtime error with the return value as “undefined”. The scope of the undeclared
                variables is always global. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h2>
            <p>We can add new elements dynamically in JavaScript by using the "createElement()" method.</p>
            <p>Code for adding new elements dynamically is here :- </p>
            <p>
            <pre>
                <u><b>CODE :-</b></u>

                    document.createElement("&lt; tagName &gt;");  
                    // Where &lt; tagName &gt; can be any HTML 
                    // tagName like div, ul, button, etc.
                    
                    // newDiv element has been created
                    For Eg: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");
            </pre>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h2>
            <p>The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end,
                making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, making
                it easy to manage content from this end too.</p>
            <table border="2" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0">

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Viewstate value is accessible with in the same page.</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages.</td>

            <h2>8. What is === operator?</h2>
            <p>The strict equality ( === ) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean
                result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of
                different types to be different.</p>
            <p>it is called strict equality ( === ) operator. It is a part of Relational(Comparison) operator in JS.</p>
            <p>The strict equality ( === ) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean
                result.
            </p>
            <p>It means strict equality ( === ) returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two
                variables.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>9. How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h2>
            <p>There is two ways we can change the style/class of an element in JavaScript.</p>
            <p>method 1 : Changing CSS with the help of the style property :-</p>
            <p style="color: black;"><b>Syntax : document.getElementById("id").style.property = new_style</b></p>
            <p>method 2 : Changing the class itself – We can use two properties that can be used to manipulate the
                classes.</p>
            <p style="color: orangered;">1. The classList Property: The classList is a read-only property that returns
                the CSS class names of an
                element as a DOMTokenList object.</p>
            <p style="color: black;"><b>Syntax : document.getElementById("id").classList</b></p><br>
            <p>You can use the below-mentioned methods to add classes, remove classes, and toggle between different
                classes respectively :-</p>
            <p>A. The add() method: It adds one or more classes.</p>
            <p>B. The remove() method: It removes one or more classes.</p>
            <p>C. The toggle() method: If the class does not exist it adds it and returns true. It removes the class and
                returns false. The second boolean argument forces the class to be added or removed.</p>
            <p style="color: orangered;">2. The className Property: This property is used to set the current class of
                the element to the specified
                class.</p>
            <p style="color: black;"><b>Syntax : document.getElementById("id").className = class</b></p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>1. file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content</p>
            <p>2. str = fread(file,flength(file)) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file.</p>
            <p>3. file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript.</p>
            <p>The file is read using the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method. This technique reads the
                full file into memory and stores it in a buffer.</p>
            <p style="color: black;"><b>Syntax : fs.readFile( file_name, encoding, callback_function )</b></p>
            <p style="color: black;"> <b>Parameters :- </b></p>
            <p> 1. filename :- <br>
                It contains the filename to be read, or the whole path if the file is saved elsewhere. <br><br>
                2. encoding :- <br>
                It stores the file’s encoding. ‘utf8’ is the default setting. <br><br>
                3. callback function :- <br>
                This is a function that is invoked after the file has been read. It requires two inputs. <br><br>
                4. err :- <br>
                If there was an error. <br><br>
                5. data :- <br>
                The file’s content. <br><br>
                6. Return Value :- <br>
                It returns the contents contained in the file, as well as any errors that may have occurred.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>The fs.writeFile() function is used to write data to a file in an asynchronous manner. If the file
                already exists, it will be replaced.</p>
            <p style="color: black;"><b>Syntax : fs.writeFile( file_name, data, options, callback )</b></p>
            <p style="color: black;"><b>Parameters :-</b></p>
            <p>File_name :- <br>
                It’s a string, a buffer, a URL, or a file description integer that specifies the location of the file to
                be written. When you use a file descriptor, it will function similarly to the fs. write() method.
                <br><br>
                Data :- <br>
                The data that will be sent to the file is a string, Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView. <br><br>
                Options :- <br>
                It’s a string or object that may be used to indicate optional output options. It includes three more
                parameters that may be selected. <br><br>
                Encoding :- <br>
                It’s a string value that indicates the file’s encoding. ‘utf8’ is the default setting. <br><br>
                Mode :- <br>
                The file mode is specified by an integer number called mode. 0o666 is the default value. <br><br>
                Flag :- <br>
                This is a string that indicates the file-writing flag. ‘w’ is the default value. <br><br>
                Callback :- <br>
                This function gets invoked when the method is run. <br><br>
                Err :- <br>
                If the process fails, this is the error that will be thrown.

            <h2>11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p style="color: black;">JavaScript supports different kinds of loops :-</p>
            <p>1. for :- loops through a block of code a number of times.</p>
            <p>2. for/in :- loops through the properties of an object.</p>
            <p>3. for/of :- loops through the values of an iterable object.</p>
            <p>4. while :- loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.</p><br>
            <p>Basically loop structures allow you to run one or more lines of code repetitively.</p>
            <p>You can repeat the statements in a loop structure until a condition is True , until a condition is False
                , a specified number of times, or once for each element in a collection.</p>
            <p>The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops. It
                makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.</p>
            <p>There are four types of loops in JavaScript :-</p>
            <p style="color: black;">
                1. for loop. <br>
                2. while loop. <br>
                3. do-while loop. <br>
                4. for-in loop. <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>To convert a string into integer we can use parseInt(), Number() and Unary operator(+).</p>
            <p>For converting the string of any base to an intenger in JavaScript, we would be using a method (or a
                function) provided by JavaScript called as parseInt().</p>
            <p>This is a special method, provided by JavaScript, that takes an integer value (of any base which is
                either specified or not) and further converts the string into an integer value.</p>
            <p>Following is the syntax that a user may use to convert a string into an integer value (of any base) :-
            </p>
            <p style="color: black;"> <b>Syntax : parseInt(string_value, base)</b></p><br>
            <p>Alternatively, if we don’t want to specify the base value and just want to convert our string value into
                an integer value itself, then we may use the following syntax also :-</p>
            <p style="color: black;"><b>Syntax : parseInt(string_value)</b></p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>13. What is the function of the delete operator?</h2>
            <p>The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are
                no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.
            </p>
            <p>The function of delete operator is to set the value of an object property to null or undefined. But the
                property will still exist in the object and some operators like for in loop will still show the presence
                of the null or undefined property.</p>
            <p>Using the delete property in loops slows down the program significantly. So, this method should only be
                used when it is absolutely necessary to delete an object property.</p>
            <p>The delete operator doesn’t work for variables or function, it returns false and the actual variables and
                functions remain untouched.
                Another thing to keep in mind is that this operator doesn’t delete property value rather the property
                itself.</p>
            <p>So, using pop(), shift(), or splice() methods is clearly a better approach to deleting array elements.

            <p style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;"> <b>1. Alert Box :- </b></p>
            <p> It is used when a warning message is needed to be produced. When the alert box is displayed to the user,

            <p>It is a type of pop up box which is used to get the user input for further use. After entering the
                required details user have to click ok to proceed next stage else by pressing the cancel button user
                returns the null value.</p>

            <h2>15. What is the use of Void (0)?</h2>
            <p>The void operator is often used merely to obtain the undefined primitive value, usually using void(0)
                (which is equivalent to void 0 ). In these cases, the global variable undefined can be used.</p>
            <p>JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term
                “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused
                while inserting an expression in a web page.</p>
            <p style="color: black;"><b>Example :- Using “javascript:void(0);” in anchor tag :-</b></p>
            <p>Writing “javascript:void(0);” in anchor tag can prevent the page to reload and JavaScript functions & can
                be called on single or double clicks easily.</p>
            <p>However, in the old browsers which run ES3 engine, undefined is a global property and can be changed. On
                the other hand, it's not possible to override the void operator. Hence, void is used as a replacement
                for undefined to get the undefined value in a safe way.</p>

                location object to set the URL of a new page.</p>

            <li>Even if you use += like “innerHTML = innerHTML + ‘html'” still the old content is replaced by html</li>
            <li>The entire innerHTML content is re-parsed and builds into elements. Therefore, it’s much slower</li>
            <li>The innerHTML does not provide validation, and therefore we can potentially insert valid and broken HTML

                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
                    multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</p>
                <p>In simple words,</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that
                    allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and
                    style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.</p>

                    or not. If the value passed is NaN, the function returns true else, it returns false.</p>

                <p>The symbol “-∞” is used to denote negative infinity. <br>It is an infinitely long zip line in
                    opposite directions.</p>
                <p>Number. NEGATIVE_INFINITY returns negative infinity.<br>Number. NEGATIVE_INFINITY is "a number lower

                <p>method 2 : Changing the class itself – We can use two properties that can be used to manipulate the
                    classes.
                <blockquote>
                    1. The classList Property: The classList is a read-only property that returns the CSS class names of
                    an element as a DOMTokenList object.<br><b>Syntax : document.getElementById("id").classList</b>
                    <br>

                        between different
                        classes respectively.
                        <br><br>
                        1. The add() method: It adds one or more classes.<br>
                        2. The remove() method: It removes one or more classes.<br>
                        3. The toggle() method: If the class does not exist it adds it and returns true. It removes the
                        class and returns false. The second boolean argument forces the class to be added or removed.

                <h2>11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>Basically loop structures allow you to run one or more lines of code repetitively.</p>
                <p>You can repeat the statements in a loop structure until a condition is True , until a condition is
                    False , a specified number of times, or once for each element in a collection.</p>
                <p>The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in
                    loops. It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.
                    <br>
                    There are four types of loops in JavaScript.
                <ol>
                    <li>for loop</li>
                    <li>while loop</li>

                <p>For converting the string of any base to an intenger in JavaScript, we would be using a method (or a
                    function) provided by JavaScript called as parseInt(). </p>
                <p>This is a special method, provided by JavaScript, that takes an integer value (of any base which is
                    either specified or not) and further converts the string into an integer value.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    Following is the syntax that a user may use to convert a string into an integer value (of any base)

                    Alternatively, if we don’t want to specify the base value and just want to convert our string value
                    into an integer value itself, then we may use the following syntax also

                <h2>13. What is the function of the delete operator?</h2>
                <p>The function of delete operator is to set the value of an object property to null or undefined. But the property will still exist in the object and some operators like for in loop will still show the presence of the null or undefined property.</p>
                <p>Using the delete property in loops slows down the program significantly. So, this method should only be used when it is absolutely necessary to delete an object property.</p>
                <p>
                    The delete operator doesn’t work for variables or function, it returns false and the actual variables and functions remain untouched.
                    <br>
                    Another thing to keep in mind is that this operator doesn’t delete property value rather the property itself.
                </p>
                <p>So, using pop(), shift(), or splice() methods is clearly a better approach to deleting array elements.</p>

                <h2>15. What is the use of Void (0)?</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Example :- Using “javascript:void(0);” in anchor tag:</b> Writing “javascript:void(0);” in anchor tag can prevent the page to reload and JavaScript functions & can be called on single or double clicks easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, in the old browsers which run ES3 engine, undefined is a global property and can be changed. On the other hand, it's not possible to override the void operator. Hence, void is used as a replacement for undefined to get the undefined value in a safe way.

                <ul>
                    <li>Content is replaced everywhere</li>
                    <li>We cannot use it like “appending to innerHTML</li>

                    <li>The entire innerHTML content is re-parsed and builds into elements. Therefore, it’s much slower
                    </li>
                    <li>The innerHTML does not provide validation, and therefore we can potentially insert valid and
